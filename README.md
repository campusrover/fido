# Fido

Fido is an end-to-end platform for robot development.

Similar to [Jyro](https://github.com/Calysto/jyro), a Python-based robot simulation library, this project provides an API for robot control, model building, and simulation creation.

Fido is developed as an independent study project at Brandeis University for robotics education.

## Installation

TBD. Stay tuned.
